* TODO Value() and err
  thet fact that Value() returns an error means that we're already
  doing some parsing in the lexer; though the book mentioned that the
  phases are not utterly distinct, shouldn't we practice it thus
  initially?
* TODO token struct
  interesting: their token struct include regular expressions (mine,
  merely predicates?):
  http://search.cpan.org/~pscust/ParseLex-2.19/lib/Parse/Token.pm
* TODO fmt.Scan
  S-expressions over a Scan interface: http://pastie.org/979383

  Scan handles the mechanics, apparently, of rune-by-rune processing.
