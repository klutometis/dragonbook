* DONE as opposed to explicitly copying struct
  CLOSED: [2010-06-07 Mon 04:46]
  exploit the copy-on-pass-by-value semantics.
* TODO file
  at some point, lexan is going to have to accept files/input streams.
* TODO repl
  - forked, compilable :: http://github.com/qrush/go-repl
  - bash-based :: http://sigpipe.org/go/tools/gorepl
* TODO lineNumber as pointer
  should we just take an int and return the new int, updating
  optionally on the calling side?

  state struct, including line number?
* TODO Value() and err
  thet fact that Value() returns an error means that we're already
  doing some parsing in the lexer; though the book mentioned that the
  phases are not utterly distinct, shouldn't we practice it thus
  initially?
* TODO token struct
  interesting: their token struct include regular expressions (mine,
  merely predicates?):
  http://search.cpan.org/~pscust/ParseLex-2.19/lib/Parse/Token.pm
* TODO fmt.Scan
  S-expressions over a Scan interface: http://pastie.org/979383

  Scan handles the mechanics, apparently, of rune-by-rune processing.
